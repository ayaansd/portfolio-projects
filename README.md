End-to-end Data Science, Engineering, Analytics &amp; Business Analyst projects — from ETL pipelines and ML models to BI dashboards and GenAI agents

Data Portfolio — Engineering, Analytics, Science & Business Insights

Hi, I’m Syed Ayaan Ahmed — a Data Scientist & Engineer passionate about solving business problems with data, machine learning, and AI.

This portfolio is a collection of real-world, end-to-end projects I’ve built — spanning Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Science, and Business Analysis.
Each project is designed to reflect how I work on the job: from raw data pipelines to ML models to dashboards and even GenAI-powered business agents.

📌 Why This Portfolio?

I didn’t want a bunch of toy examples. Instead, I built production-style projects that:

Ingest & transform realistic-scale datasets (100K+ to millions of rows)

Deliver business impact through dashboards, KPIs, and actionable insights

Apply modern data stack tools — Airflow, Spark, BigQuery, XGBoost, Power BI, FastAPI, Hugging Face

Mirror the roles I target → Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Analyst
