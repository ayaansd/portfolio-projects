# 🚀 My Data Portfolio  
*End-to-end projects across Data Engineering, Analytics, Data Science & Business Insights*  

Hi, I’m **Syed Ayaan Ahmed** — a Data Scientist & Engineer passionate about solving business problems with **data, machine learning, and AI**.  

This portfolio is a collection of **production-style, real-world projects** I’ve built — spanning **ETL pipelines, ML models, BI dashboards, and GenAI agents**.  
Each project reflects how I work on the job: from **raw data ingestion → transformation → modeling → insights** that drive business impact.  

---

## 📌 Why This Portfolio?  
I didn’t want a collection of toy notebooks. These projects are designed to:  
- ⚡ **Handle real-scale datasets** (100K+ to millions of rows)  
- 📊 **Deliver impact** via dashboards, KPIs, and actionable insights  
- 🛠 **Leverage the modern data stack** (Airflow, Spark, BigQuery, XGBoost, Power BI, FastAPI, Hugging Face)  
- 🎯 **Align to real roles**: Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Analyst
